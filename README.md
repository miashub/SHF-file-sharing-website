# üîê Secure File Sharing Platform

A collaborative course project built with **Django**, this web app allows users to upload, encrypt, share, and manage files securely. Designed to simulate real-world file security workflows, it leverages cryptography to store sensitive content safely and enables sharing with access control.

### **Live Demo**

- **Frontend + Backend (Render):** [https://sfh-web.onrender.com](https://sfh-web.onrender.com)

---

### **Key Features**

- **User Registration & Login:** Authenticate securely with built-in Django auth.
- **Encrypted Uploads:** Files are encrypted using Fernet (AES) before being stored.
- **Secure Downloads:** Only the uploader or shared users can decrypt and download.
- **File Previews:** Inline preview support for images, PDFs, text, and videos.
- **Access Control:** Share files with selected registered users.
- **PostgreSQL Integration:** Persistent database powered by Render PostgreSQL.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Django admin enabled for managing users and files.
